# Uncommon SQL Errors
This repository demonstrates some uncommon yet critical errors that can occur in SQL queries.  These errors often involve implicit type conversions, NULL value handling, and unexpected behavior when comparing different data types.

**Common Errors Covered:**
* Implicit type conversion when comparing numeric columns to string literals.
* Incorrect handling of NULL values when using comparison operators.
* String comparison instead of numeric comparison when the data types are inconsistent.

**Solutions:**
The `bugSolution.sql` file provides corrected versions of the queries, emphasizing explicit type casting and the appropriate use of operators for handling NULL values.
